              The player stands in front of a hoard of dead enemies located near a zombie spawmer they encountered while exploring the maze hunting for this levels puzzle as signified by the beacon shining nearby.

              The player is backing away from the brute enemy as he charges to gear up for an attack. The player stays near the spawner in hopes of farming zombies to kill near the souldbox located in the room to the right of the player.

            <P>
              The player encounters another wave of enemies after recently defeating the enemies near the spawning portal. The ice trap in the distance would allow the player a easier escape from the zombies if they were to be overwhelmed by the spawner.

              The player encounters the soul box puzzle while exploring the maze. The light from the beacons and wall lights can be seen reflecting off the glossy metal of the floor and walls creating a great lightsource for the player.

              The Neon Maze makes up the complex final level in which the player must solve all of the different puzzles located within the game with the level having a mini maze for each puzzle within the full level
