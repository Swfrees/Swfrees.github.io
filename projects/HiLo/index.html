              The starting screen where the user is able to input their username which is saved by the program until the program is closed.

              The player is addressed by their inputted username, along with being given the option to guess or quit the game. If the player chooses something outside of those two options there are failsafes in place to ensure the user does not break the program.

          <P>
            The player has guessed the wrong number and after comparing the guess to the randomized number generated after the username was inputted the game has informed them the guess was too low.

          <P>
            The player made a invalid guess after learning more information based on the previous guess that was too high compared to the random number and the game has informed them of it.
